    "- It sets the \"vintage type\" column based on the value extracted from the source code, where 0 represents vintage wine, 1 represents non-vintage wine, and 2 and beyond represent unknown (which will be checked manually later).\n",

    "- <code>sanitize</code>: This function takes a string input and removes any invalid characters to generate a sanitized version of the input string. It replaces spaces with underscores, removes special characters and converts the string to lowercase. It is useful for generating clean file names for images or other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>clean_data</code>: This function takes a DataFrame as input and performs several data cleaning tasks, such as dropping unnecessary columns, renaming columns, converting data types, and handling missing values. It also calls the 'sanitize' function to sanitize values in certain columns. The cleaned DataFrame is returned as the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>full_name</code>: This function takes a DataFrame as input and creates a full name for wines by combining values from the 'producer', 'cuvee_name', and 'nv' columns. If the 'nv' value is 'NV', it is appended to the cuvee name. The resulting full names are returned as a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>get_grapes</code>: This function takes a DataFrame as input and extracts grape names from code pieces in the 'grape' column. It uses string manipulation and evaluation of string expressions to parse the grape names. The extracted grape names are cleaned and stored in the 'grape' column of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <code>save_images</code>: This function takes a DataFrame and a file path as input and parses and saves images of height 600 and 960 from URLs in the DataFrame. It uses the 'img_med' and 'img_large' columns to retrieve the image URLs, and the 'full_name' column to generate file names for the images. The images are saved in the specified file paths with the sanitized directory name as the file name and the file extension '.png'.\n",
